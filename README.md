Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  You can click on 'Demo' written above in this ReadME file
- What was your experience?
  It was harder than expected because I wanted to build the website using a particular method I had in mind at first gaze. However, the method later gave me a problem which was that the website was responsive on desktop and but not on mobile. After some thinking and debugging, I realized that I had to be flexible with the solution. In all, it was fun.
- What have you learned/improved?
  My flexibility and understanding of how website responsiveness really works.
- Your wisdom? :)
  There's always more that meets the eye.
